In this project I created a game using Swift and UIKit that shows some random flags to users and asks them to choose which one belongs to a particular country.

In this project I revisited Interface Builder, Auto Layout, outputs and other stuff, but at the same time I also learned about @2x and @3x images, entity catalogs, UIButton, CALayer, UIColor, random numbers, actions, UIAlertController, and more.
